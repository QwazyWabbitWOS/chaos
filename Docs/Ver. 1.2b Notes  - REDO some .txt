  2. An invulnerable player would die from the kamikaze.

   /*
   ==============================================================================
   PACKET FILTERING

   You can add or remove addresses from the filter list with:

   addip <ip>
   removeip <ip>

   The ip address is specified in dot format, and any unspecified digits will match any value, so you can specify an entire class C network with "addip 192.246.40".
   Removeip will only remove an address specified exactly the same way.  You cannot addip a subnet, then removeip a single host.

   listip
   Prints the current list of filters.

   writeip
   Dumps "addip <ip>" commands to listip.cfg so it can be execed at a later date.  The filter lists are not saved and restored by default, because I beleive it would cause too much confusion.

   filterban <0 or 1>
   If 1 (the default), then ip addresses matching the current list will be prohibited from entering the game.  This is the default setting.
   If 0, then only addresses matching the list will be allowed.  This lets you easily set up a private game, or a game that only allows players from your local network.
   ==============================================================================
   */
