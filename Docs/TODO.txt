This need to get done in no particular order .. they just need to be done
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I don't think we should make any huge changes to a long existing mod, regardless of whatever dev plan they had in the late 90's
	at least without one master cvar disabling all of them, then if the master cvar is enabled the "new" items should be controllable via individual cvars - MrG{DRGN}

No:

	* New configuration file format

	* proxy grenades stick to people -  they blow up on contact with an enemy.
	* reduce health on grenades -  Not even sure what this means.

	* Z-Bot detection

	* increase cell consumption on scanner and anti-grav belt - let's not alienate our already reduced player-base. It works just fine as is. 

	* make anti-grav belt act as some sort of minor protection against vortex
 
	* light saber upgrade for sword possibly - overdone in other mods and is really just an old Qdevels tutorial. 

	* upgrade grapple hook to be able to grab items and bring them to you and
	  possible be able to swing other players around.  Also, be able to cut
	  grapple cable with sword/chainsaw/lightsaber - this would really change the game in a not so great way and be a pain to code.

	* Compression grenades - Not sure what that is, and we have enough grenade types

	* Night Vision goggles - we have a flashlight
	
	* Freeze adaptation to Airfist - 

	* flamethrower for Airfist if possible - 

	* light saber upgrade for sword possibly  - overdone in other mods and is really just an old Qdevels tutorial. 
	
	* Airgun can push players through physical objects and get them stuck in walls - Feature

	* Occasionally a Vortex grabs a player and pulls them through a wall - Feature


Probably no:

	* Arrows stick to people - not sure if this is possible.

Maybe:

	* Add spotlight to the turrets -  would be nice for lightsoff mode gamemaps, but not sure how to code this.


In progress:

	* Clean up Bugs, Optimize code

	* upgrade Havok Bots

	* Game occasionally sig11's in Linux and Segfaults in Win95, possibly memory
	  leak somewhere (this will be painful to fix)
	  // FWP One segfault cause (turret crash) fixed.  May be others. 
	  MrG{DRGN} - Unsure if this is still an issue

	  * Error messages appearing to client's "yada yada no such oldframe",seems to happen when player runs out of ammo and autoswitches to new weapon, also appears to be harmless. - May be fixed

Done:
