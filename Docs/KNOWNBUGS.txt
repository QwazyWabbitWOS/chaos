These are Known bugs in Chaotic Dreams v1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Airgun can push players through physical objects and get them stuck in walls - Feature

* Game occasionally sig11's in Linux and Segfaults in Win95, possibly memory
  leak somewhere (this will be painfull to fix)
// FWP One segfault cause (turret crash) fixed.  May be others.

* Occasionally a Vortex grabs a player and pulls them through a wall - Feature

* If you fakedeath while having the jetpack active the model animation is
  screwed up and locked into a STANDING position.  The problem is that i am
  not certain which is the bug, the model animation beeing screwed or the fact
  that they can fakedeath while using a jetpack. may be fixed

* Bugs with CTF spectator modes - maybe fixed

* Error messages appearing to clients "yada yada no such oldframe",seems to happen when player runs out of ammo and autoswitches to new weapon, also appears to be harmless. - May be fixed
