Havoc Bot Node Table Generation Tutorial
========================================

While Havoc Bot v0.8 supports dynamic node table generation 
(generation while you play against the bots) building quality node
table files needs more care and time.

NOTE: v0.8 does not support CTF AI, yet. You can play with bots in CTF games
      but they won't go for the map.

NOTE: The pathing system supports elevators, ladders, teleporters, water and jumps
      but no trains (will be implemented in a future version).

NOTE: The node table system supports up to 450 nodes (I'm working on a faster
      routine...will be increased to 750 or more in the next version)

To create a new node table file:

1)  Start the map you want to create nodes for.
2)  Execute the file node.cfg, it sets all console variables
    and binds all keys you'll need.
3)  Walk straight lines, cover the whole level.
    Don't pickup items close to your way as you walk straight down a hallway
    the bots automatically go for close (2-3 meters) items.
4)  Don't jump down to elevators, step on them.
5)  Be very careful when climbing ladders, look straight towards the ladder
    as you climb.
6)  Don't use the grappling hook or Jetpack while you create nodes.
7)  Try not to fall into lava/slime.
8)  Try not to die.
9)  The bots do not understand trains, yet (as all other bots I know) so
    don't try to map them...find ways around.
10) Try to get to all items on the map, so the bots can find them later on.
11) Jump only if you need to, don't jump around just for fun.
12) Use 'cmd pathdebug' to visualize a path. The green line shows the path from you to
    little skull.
13) Use 'cmd placenode' to place nodes by hand...this is useful to cover holes in the
    node system that can sometimes be found using pathdebug.
14) Use 'cmd save_nodes' to save the nodes table to a file (same name as the current map)
    in the subdirectory 'nodes'.
15) If you think that your node system is complete set dntg to 0 before you save the nodes.
    This settings will be saved together with the nodes to prevent the game from setting dntg
    to 1 again for this map.
16) If you want to delete and restart a node table, just delete the node file for this map
    in the 'nodes' subdirectory.

NOTE: node.cfg executes the following commands:
-----------------------------------------------
set dntg 1 (set dynamic-node-table-generation to on)
set node_debug 1 (prints ingame debug messages)
bind s save_nodes (bind 's' to save node table for current map)
bind l load_nodes (bind 'l' to load node table for current map)
bind d pathdebug (bind 'd' to visualize a path
bind p placenodes (bind 'p' to place a node 'by hand')


Hope this small tutorial helps!
